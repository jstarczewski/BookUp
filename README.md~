First version of unfinished Reading Assistant.

## About BookUp (Reading Assistant)
Doesn't matter whether you are into philosophy, or you just want to improve yourself. The problem of overloading your brain with knowledge from books that require much more than "keeping eyes open" always leads to forgetting key content of what you read. Solve this problem by writing down everything you consider valuable, always be able to quickly remind yourself of what you have learned, read. Never again experience the problem that happens in conversations, when you really want to present your point of view, but forgot what you had read. Maybe self-improvement is really important to you? Now you can motivate yourself, not only by seeing the progress that you keep reading, but also that you make best of it and always have most valuable quotes with you. Simple 2-dimensional notepad dedicated for everyone who experienced "overloading'' is now for you to store the key content of what you read, offline.

## Get BookUp
